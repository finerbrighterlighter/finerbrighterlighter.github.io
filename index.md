# About me
-------

From Myanmar (Burma), but I consider myself a citizen of where I am sleeping today. 

I did practice dentistry until graduation in 2018 and never looked back since. 

Currently based in [Bangkok](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/Th-Bangkok_ceremonial_name.ogg "Krungthepmahanakhon Amonrattanakosin Mahintharayutthaya Mahadilokphop Noppharatratchathaniburirom Udomratchaniwetmahasathan Amonphimanawatansathit Sakkathattiyawitsanukamprasit") of Thailand, I am working for health care research, with data science concentration.

Mainly fascinated with secondary data research, I am enthused to explore **why, what, and how we should reuse** regarding electronic medical records and data collected for other purposes. 

I majorly code in Python with occasional R.

In my free time, I prefer to keep myself in my room; listening to music, walking around with a headset or watching tv shows/anime on repeat.

Here's a playlist of my most listened songs in [2022](https://music.apple.com/th/playlist/replay-2019/pl.rp-BooEUbOj66bP "Replay 2022"), [2021](https://music.apple.com/th/playlist/replay-2021/pl.rp-8AA9cXvO44Xo "Replay 2021"), [2020](https://music.apple.com/th/playlist/replay-2020/pl.rp-P449SYAZaaYV "Replay 2020"), and [2019](https://music.apple.com/th/playlist/replay-2019/pl.rp-BooEUbOj66bP "Replay 2019"). And yes, Hamilton was released on Disney+ in 2020.

Occasionally, I take [photos of stuffs](https://unsplash.com/@finerbrighterlighter "Unsplash"). Here's [my MAL profile](https://myanimelist.net/profile/fibrili "MyAnimeList"), but I usually fail to update.
