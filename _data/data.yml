  summary: |
    Currently based in [Bangkok](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/Th-Bangkok_ceremonial_name.ogg "Krungthepmahanakhon Amonrattanakosin Mahintharayutthaya Mahadilokphop Noppharatratchathaniburirom Udomratchaniwetmahasathan Amonphimanawatansathit Sakkathattiyawitsanukamprasit") of Thailand, I am working for health care research, with data science concentration.
    Mainly fascinated with secondary data research, I am enthused to explore **why, what, and how we should reuse** regarding electronic medical records and data collected for other purposes. 

    I maintain and manage two large real-world cohorts curated from routine clinical visits data over 13-years period; one including [276,500 hypertensive patients](https://www.rama.mahidol.ac.th/ceb/CEBdatawarehouse/Data/HT) and another including [17,350 patients who underwent abdominal surgery](https://www.rama.mahidol.ac.th/ceb/CEBdatawarehouse/Data/Surgery). Two peer-reviewed papers have been published with subsequent studies being conducted.
      
    I majorly code in Python with occasional R. I have experience in medical data wrangling for secondary data research projects, and applying sociodemographic data for screening algorithms/ clinical decision support.
