This is beta build for a personal website using github pages. The domain is  purchased from [namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/), built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and hosted by [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/), as guided in [JONATHAN MCGLONE](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/)'s guide.
It is my first time curating a webpage and basically my second time using html after the [ssignment project](https://github.com/finerbrighterlighter/AQ10_questionnaire) 2 years ago. The code is spaghetti af, lines are reduntant and not a good example of how it could be. But I am proud of me, learning how to html in a day. Gotta say it was a productive day.
