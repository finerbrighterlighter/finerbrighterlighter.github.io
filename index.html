            		<p style="float:right; display:block; text-align: left;"> From Myanmar(Burma), but I consider myself a citizen of where I am sleeping today. I did dentistry as my undergraduate study, and now I am working in the field of health care research. Mainly interested in secondary data research, I am enthused in why we reuse, what we reuse, how we reuse regarding Electronic medical records. </p>
			<p style="float:right; display:block; text-align: left;"> In my free time, I prefer to keep myself in my room, walking around with a headset on, watching sitcoms and anime on repeat.In no way a connoisseur of cinema, I watch as long as they are fun.</p>
