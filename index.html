		<p> From Myanmar (Burma), but I consider myself a citizen of where I am sleeping today. I did practice dentistry as my undergraduate study until the graduation in 2018 and never looked back since. Currently based in Bangkok Thailand, I am working in the field of health care research, concentrating in data science and clinical data research. Mainly interested in secondary data research, I am enthused to explore why we should reuse, what we should reuse, how we should reuse regarding electronic medical records and data collected for other purposes. I mainly work with Python with occasional R for resource limitations.</p>

		<p>In my free time, I prefer to keep myself in my room, listening to music, walking around with a headset, watching sitcoms or anime on repeat. Watching people watch the shows I enjoyed is a guilty pleasure but I am not proud that I am encouraging copyrights infringements.</p>
		<p>Here's a playlist of my most listened songs in 2022, 
		<a href="https://music.apple.com/th/playlist/replay-2021/pl.rp-8AA9cXvO44Xo">2021</a>,
		<a href="https://music.apple.com/th/playlist/replay-2020/pl.rp-P449SYAZaaYV"> 2020</a>, and
		<a href="https://music.apple.com/th/playlist/replay-2019/pl.rp-BooEUbOj66bP"> 2019</a>.
		 I like to think my music taste is pretty diverse in genre and language, but somehow this hundred is overwhelmed with English and Japanese. And yes, 2020 was the year Hamilton became available on Disney+.</p>
