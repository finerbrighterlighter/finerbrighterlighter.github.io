	<h1>Htun Teza</h1>
	<body>
		<p>I am Htun Teza from Myanmar(Burma), </p>
		<p>but I consider myself a citizen of where I am sleeping today. </p>
		<p>I did dentistry as my undergraduate study, and now I am working in the field of health care research. </p>
		<p>Mainly interested in Secondary data research, I dabble in what to reuse, how to reuse, why to use regarding with Electronic medical records. </p>

		<p>In my free time, I prefer to keep myself in my room, walking around with a headset on, watching sitcoms and anime on repeat.</p>
		<p>In no way a connoisseur of cinema, I watch as long as they are fun.</p>
