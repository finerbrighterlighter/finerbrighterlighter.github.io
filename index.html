		<p> From Myanmar(Burma), but I consider myself a citizen of where I am sleeping today. I did dentistry as my undergraduate study, and now I am working in the field of health care research. Mainly interested in secondary data research, I am enthused to explore why we reuse, what we reuse, how we reuse regarding Electronic medical records.</p>
		<p> In my free time, I prefer to keep myself in my room, walking around with a headset on, watching sitcoms and anime on repeat.</p>
