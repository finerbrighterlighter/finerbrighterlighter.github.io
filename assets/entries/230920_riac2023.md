Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital recently hosted the [Ramathibodi International Academic Conference (RIAC) 2023](https://riac.onvirtual-meeting.com/home.php), which took place from September 20th to 22nd at the Bangkok Marriott Marquis Queen's Park. During this event, CEB-RAMA-MU had the opportunity to highlight our expertise in real-world data research. <span />
<br/><br/>

RIAC serves as an annual scientific meeting where various departments of the faculty showcase their research and accomplishments. It also serves as a platform to foster discussions and encourage collaborations among professionals. The conference received support from both local and international partners within the medical and pharmaceutical industries.
<br/><br/>

I had the privilege of being a speaker in the "CEB Data Warehouse Showcase" section, where I presented my work focused on the Hypertension theme. During my presentation, I shared the latest updates on our cohort and presented the findings from our first peer-reviewed publication based on this cohort. Furthermore, I had the chance to discuss why real world data is important in medical research and my experiences in tackling a common challenge: data sparsity. The slides can be found [here](/assets/docs/RIAC2023/RIAC2023_hypertension.pdf) and [here](/assets/docs/RIAC2023/RIAC2023_imputation.pdf).
