CEB-RAMA-MU hosted Dr. Olivia Wu from Glasgow University and various academics across Thailand to discuss on the topic of research using real world data. I was invited for participation as a speaker under the topic “Real World Data in Ramathibodi Hospital” to share our experience of extracting and curating medical data from Electronic Health Records.
