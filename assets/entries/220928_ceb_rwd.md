CEB-RAMA-MU hosted Dr. Olivia Wu from Glasgow University and various academics across Thailand to discuss on the topic of research using real world data. I was invited for participation as a speaker under the topic “Real World Data in Ramathibodi Hospital” to share our experience of extracting and curating medical data from Electronic Health Records. <span /> My presentation included indentification of the cohort and extraction of the features, regarding [Hypertension Data Warehouse](https://www.rama.mahidol.ac.th/ceb/CEBdatawarehouse/Data/HT "Hypertension Data Warehouse @ Web"). The slides for the presentation can be found [here](/assets/docs/realworlddata.pdf).
