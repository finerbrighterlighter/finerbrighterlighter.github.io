I have just got my first publication of my research journey, titled "Evaluation of transitions from early hypertension to hypertensive chronic kidney disease, coronary artery disease, stroke and mortality: A Thai real-world data cohort" in a Q1 journal by Frontiers Media.
<span />
The project identified 144,149 hypertensive patients at early uncomplicated stages over 13 years (2010-2022), and analyzed the progression to complications associated with Hypertensive over the study period (median, 3.6 years). We observed that chronic kidney disease is the most common early complication in our population although it had the lowest risk of mortality compared to the other studied complications. The presence of chronic kidney disease in hypertensive patients increased the probability of developing subsequent coronary artery disease. For our next project, we plan to study factors influencing such transitions and thir effects on each.

Currently, the abstract can be found [here](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcvm.2023.1170010/abstract "abstract @ frontiers"). The manuscript will be available [here](http://doi.org/10.3389/fcvm.2023.1170010 "full text @ frontiers via doi") soon.

Great thanks to Associate Editor Nicola Riccardo Pugliese, Reviewer Editors Nicol√≤ De Biase and Alessio Balletti at University of Pisa for their very prompt yet comprehensive responses.
