I was invited as a symposium speaker under the theme “NCDs: Bridging the Gaps” in 23rd National Institutes of Health (Malaysia) Scientific Conference. <span /> We discussed our work with Non-communicable diseases and real world data from electronic medical records at CEB-RAMA-MU. My presentation included indentification of the cohort, extraction of the features and updating the cohort, regarding [Hypertension Data Warehouse](https://www.rama.mahidol.ac.th/ceb/CEBdatawarehouse/Data/HT "Hypertension Data Warehouse @ Web"). The slides for the presentation can be found [here](/assets/docs/mohammsc.pdf), and the clip for the presentation [here](https://youtu.be/44IAklz9oOA&autoplay=0 "DSCI-CEB-RAMA-MU @ 14th MOH-AMM SC 2022 @ Youtube").
