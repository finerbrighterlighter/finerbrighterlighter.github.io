I have just got my second publication of my research journey and of 2023, titled “External validation and revision of Penn incisional hernia prediction model: A large-scale retrospective cohort of abdominal operations” in The Surgeon; Journal of the Royal Colleges of Surgeons of Edinburgh and Ireland. 

This project in particular was memorable for me that my responsibility was solely data curation. We initiated Surgery theme in CEB Data Warehouse project and 423,704 operative cases over 11-years study period were explored. 12,155 cases of abdominal surgery for 11,617 patients were included in study population with peri-operative features were identified for externally validating and updating Penn Hernia Risk Calculator. The curated cohort was handed to Dr. Amarit Tansawet, a board certified surgeon for further analysis and drafting manuscript.

While the original model yielded fair performance with our dataset, we updated the model to improved discrimination and calibration performance. While it is a given that both the original and revised model require additional validation and necessary revision for other populations, we hope our study would help identify patients at increased risk of incisional hernia and provide improved clinical care for those in need of targeted intervention.

The abstract and full text will be online in a few weeks, and mirrored on this site. If you are interested in working on this cohort, requests for access can be directed to https://www.rama.mahidol.ac.th/ceb/CEBdatawarehouse/Submittheproposal.
