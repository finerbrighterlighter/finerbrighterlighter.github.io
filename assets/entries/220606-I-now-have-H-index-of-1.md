After 3 years of joining my masters degree in Data Science, one of my research paper has been cited making me a researcher with h-index of 1. <span /> The h-index is the largest number h such that h articles have at least h citations each. The index was suggested in 2005 by [Jorge E. Hirsch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_E._Hirsch "Jorge E. Hirsch @ Wikipedia") at University of California, San Diego giving its name the Hirsch index or Hirsch number. It is an author-level metric that measures both the productivity (i.e. number of publications) and citation impact of the publications.
