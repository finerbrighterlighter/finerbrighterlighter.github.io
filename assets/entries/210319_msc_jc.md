Part of the curriculum fulfilment for my Master of Science degree, I presented about the Mixed Effects Machine Learning models in the Journal Club.<span /> Later, I applied the framework as one of the models in my research. The resources for the Journal Club can be found [here](https://www.rama.mahidol.ac.th/ceb/news/10mar2021-0940 "CEB-RAMA-MU @ Web"). The model application can be found in my [thesis](https://htunteza.com/assets/docs/msc_thesis.pdf "Risk-factor based Diagnosis for Chronic Periodontitis using Machine Learning Models @ Web"), the [proceeding paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/351563629_Clinical_Prediction_of_Chronic_Periodontitis "Clinical Prediction of Chronic Periodontitis @ ResearchGate") and the [poster](http://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.20986.77764 "Screening models for Periodontitis @ ResearchGate"). The journal manuscript is still under review.
