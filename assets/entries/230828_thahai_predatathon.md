[Khon Kaen University](https://kku.ac.th/), in collaboration with the [Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital](https://www.rama.mahidol.ac.th/) and [Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital](https://si.mahidol.ac.th/) at [Mahidol University](https://mahidol.ac.th/), is hosting the first [Thailand Health AI Datathon](https://web.facebook.com/thaidatathon2023) from October 3 to 6, 2023. According to Professor [Feng Menglin](https://www.mornin-feng.com/) from the National University of Singapore, this will be the 50th Health AI Datathon in the world. <span />
<br/><br/>

At the pre-datathon workshop, Professor Feng joined as an invited speaker, sharing his previous work with the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care ([MIMIC-III](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201635)) data. Additionally, he shared his experiences hosting last year's Singapore Healthcare AI Datathon & Expo 2022 ([SHADE'22](https://sg-ai.org/)), raising expectations for the upcoming event.
<br/><br/>

Participants in the datathon will utilize one of the three health datasets contributed by the host institutions: the KKU Smart ICU dataset, the KKU Scleroderma dataset, and the Ramathibodi Hypertension dataset, ***for which I am the curator and data manager***. For the event, a resampled cohort of 100,000 subjects was extracted alongside their routine clinical visit data from [CEB Data Warehouse's Hypertension Theme](https://www.rama.mahidol.ac.th/ceb/CEBdatawarehouse/Data/HT), with 276,500 subjects over a 13-year period.
<br/><br/>

In addition to the three institutions, domain experts from the Asia eHealth Information Network ([AeHIN](https://www.asiaehealthinformationnetwork.org/)) and the Standards and Interoperability Lab Thailand ([SIL-TH](https://sil-th.org/)) are supporting the event alongside industrial partners [Clinixir](https://www.clinixir.com/) and [Bangkok Bank](https://www.bangkokbank.com/en). While registrations for the Datathon have been closed, the post-datathon conference is still available for registration on the [webpage](https://datathonthailand.org/) until September 30, 2023.
