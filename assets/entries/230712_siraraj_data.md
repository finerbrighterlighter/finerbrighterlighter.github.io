CEB-RAMA-MU hosted the members of Siriraj Informatics and Data Innovation Center (SiData+) and Chulalongkorn University to discuss on the topic of research using electronic medical records as real world evidence. <span /> During the event, I presented my experience of cohort identification, data preprocessing and statistical analyses regarding disease progression in 144 thousands hypertensive patients over 13 years, future plans and opportunities. Event details can be found [here](https://www.rama.mahidol.ac.th/ceb/gallery/2023/StudyVisitSiData%2BandCU%29) and the slides for the presentation [here](/assets/docs/sirarij_20230712.pdf).
