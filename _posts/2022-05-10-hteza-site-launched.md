The domain from [namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) and the site hosted on good old [github](https://github.com/).  
It's powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts.  
It follows [JONATHAN MCGLONE](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/)'s guide on how to host using [github pages](https://pages.github.com/).  
It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.
