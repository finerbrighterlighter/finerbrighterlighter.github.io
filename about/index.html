		<p>Burmese names are usually based on Pali words, and mine's no difference. Teza (တေဇ) comes from တေဇော, burmese transliteration of tejas meaning fire, in which my parents wanted to refer as the "bright light" or "bright flame". In the same Burmese fashion, I do not have a family name either; both Htun and Teza are my own names. The reasoning behind was that "where one comes from should not affect how one should be treated", but yes, it's one of those "good idea, didn't work". Of course, except when I have to communicate with like, the whole world, then I consider Teza as my last name. </p>

			<p> I hail from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyinmana">Pyinmana</a>, a small logging, sugarcane growing, horsecarts rampant town in the middle of Burma. As I hit ten, they told me we are no longer Pyinmana, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naypyidaw">Naypyidaw</a> is swallowing us and a bunch of neighboring small towns into one big empty capital of Myanmar. And that's the story how I randomly became a city dweller from a rural bumpkin overnight.</p>
			<p> My first school was Basic Education Middle School 2 in Pyinmana, affectionately known as Kanna <i>lake-side</i> school. For High school, I was in a boarding school called Nyaung Pi Lay <i>(Small Banyan)</i> in Lanmaddaw township of Yangon. Of course, back then, the system still required us to take classes in state schools as well so I attended Basic Education High School 2 of Lanmaddaw.</p>
