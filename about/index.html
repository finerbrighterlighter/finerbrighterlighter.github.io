			<p> Burmese names are usually based on Pali words, and mine's no difference. Teza (တေဇ) comes from တေဇော, burmese transliteration of tejas meaning fire, which I guess my parents named me as the "bright light" or the "bright flame". In the same Burmese fashion, I do not have a family name either meaning both Htun and Teza are my own names. The reasoning behind was that <i>where one comes from should not affect how one should be treated</i>, but yes, it's one of those "good idea, didn't work". Of course, when I have to communicate with like, the rest of the world, then I designate Teza as my last name. </p>

			<p> I hail from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyinmana">Pyinmana</a>, a small logging, sugarcane growing, horsecarts rampant town in the middle of Burma. As I hit ten, they told me we are no longer Pyinmana, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naypyidaw">Naypyidaw</a> is swallowing us and a bunch of neighboring small towns into one big empty capital of Myanmar. And that's the story how I randomly became a city dweller from a rural bumpkin overnight.</p>
			<p> I stayed in my hometown for the first 14 years of my life, at Basic Education Middle School 2 Pyinmana, affectionately known as Kanna (<i>lake-side</i>) school. For High school, I transferred to a boarding school called Nyaung Pin Lay (<i>small banyan</i>) in Lanmaddaw township of Yangon. Of course, the system back then still required us to take classes in state schools to be eligible for matriculation examinations so I attended Basic Education High School 2 of Lanmaddaw.</p>

			<p> After I graduated high school in 2012, I joined the <a href="http://udmyangon-edu.com/">University of  Dental Medicine</a> which I still cannot figure out why I did so. I knew myself going in that I am not very good at communcations, relations, and that I demand for closure in everything. As expected, I greatly abhorred being a clinician; medicine is as much of arts as it is science. YOu do your best and wait for the results. The fact that it did not have a yes or no outcome constantly stressed me out; having to say "okay, it seems it is better <i>than the last time</i>" never felt natural to me.</p>
			<p> So, as every university student who did not enjoy their time in class, I was always looking for extracurricular activities which would keep me away from the dental chair. I was always offering the postgraduate students to help them out with their research, be it data collection for their research, manual inputs into a SPSS or even format and grammar check for their documents. I was lucky enough to be noticed by the professor and lectures in the Department of Preventive and Community Dentistry (<i>PCD</i>), relatively the most active group in the university.</p>

			<p> They were very kind for making me aware that there's more to health sciences than being a clinician. They told me that there are people who figures out <i>what and how to do for which</i> so that the clinicians can practice. They gave me hours out of their own time to teach the basics of descriptive analysis, which was not part of the cirriculum, and invite me to the relevant courses or workshops. A masters degree program fo medical epidemiology was recommended to me so, I joined the program at <a href="https://www.rama.mahidol.ac.th/ceb/">Department of Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics</a>, Mahidol Univeristy six months after I finished my bachelor's degree, with the recommendation of the rector of the university and the head of the PCD department. </p>
		</div>
			<p> I insisted against the recommended program and did my masters in data science for health care, which I believe is the best decision I made in recent years. The initial learning curves were huge, but on the hindsight, I met the best people possible to guide me back on the path, attentive lecturers and collaborative classmates. I constructed risk prediction models for a periodontal disease, and one thing I was fascinated by the experience was using secondary data for the study. In the past, I had helped with subject recruitments or surveys for a couple of research projects, but I was charmed by the concept of reusing data collected for other purposes. </p>

			<p> Medical records are the longitudinal data of the patients followed up passively, and could have been used for much more purposes. When I was made aware that our department was undertaking <a href="https://www.rama.mahidol.ac.th/ceb/CEBdatawarehouse">a project</a> to extract the electronic medical records from Ramathibodi Hospital, I asked for an opportunity to join the data warehouse team. I took upon myself on curating for the Surgery project, which extracts the operative records to link with other medical parameters as required for each researcher’s goals, and I was invited to join the hypertension project midway as well. It is a great learning experience, from receiving the medical data and blinding them to exporting the dataset with those features the researchers hypothesize to be correlated. After I graduated, I joined the department back as a graduate research assistant for Data Science and Clinical Informatics division.</p>

			<p> Of course, it is not without struggles, the series of meetings when we cannot identify such parameters, pondering between extracting from other databases, imputing, replacing it or even dropping, a ton of missing values and uneven time steps or follow ups. It has been an exciting adventure, and I am convinced that we could be doing more, manually or even with automated pipelines set in places. This requires more research, studies, experiments, validations; this is a feat to overcome and I want to be a part of it. I am always looking for opportunity to work with unstructured data in addition to structured data of EHR systems, complementing the experience gained at my current position.</p>
