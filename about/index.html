	<h1>About me</h1>
	<body>
		<p>Burmese names are usually based on Pali words, and mine's no difference. Teza (တေဇ) comes from တေဇော, burmese transliteration of tejas meaning fire, in which my parents wanted to refer as the "bright light" or "bright flame". In the same Burmese fashion, I do not have a family name either; both Htun and Teza are my own names. The reasoning behind was that "where one comes from should not affect how one should be treated", but yes, it's one of those "good idea, didn't work". Of course, except when I have to communicate with like, the whole world, then I consider Teza as my last name. </p>

			<p> I hail from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyinmana">Pyinmana</a>, a small logging, sugarcane growing, horsecarts rampant town in the middle of Burma. As I hit ten, they told me we are no longer Pyinmana, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naypyidaw">Naypyidaw</a> is swallowing us and a bunch of neighboring small towns into one big empty capital of Myanmar. And that's the story how I randomly became a city dweller from a rural bumpkin overnight.</p>
			<p> I stayed in my hometown for 14 years, at Basic Education Middle School 2 Pyinmana, affectionately known as Kanna (<i>lake-side</i>) school. For High school, I was in a boarding school called Nyaung Pi Lay (<i>small banyan</i>) in Lanmaddaw township of Yangon. Of course, back then, the system still required us to take classes in state schools as well so I attended Basic Education High School 2 of Lanmaddaw.</p>

			<p> After I graduated high school in 2012, I joined the <a href="http://udmyangon-edu.com/">University of  Dental Medicine</a> for reasons I couldn't recall anymore. I knew myself going in that I am not very good at communcations and relations, and I demand for closure in everything. And as expected, I greatly despited being a clinician; medicine is as much an act as it is science. The fact that it did not have a yes or no outcome stressed me out, having to say "okay, it seems it is better than the last time" never felt natural to me.</p>
			<p> So, as every university student who did not enjoy their time in class, I was always looking for extracurricular activities which would keep me away from the dental chair. I was always offering the postgraduate students to help them out with their research, be it data collection for their research, manual inputs into a SPSS or even format and grammar check for their documents. I was lucky enough to be noticed by the professor and lectures in the Department of Preventive and Community Dentistry (<i>PCD</i>), relatively the most active group in the university.</p>

			<p> They were patient in making me aware that there's more to health sciences than being a clinician. They told me that there are people who figures out <i>what and how to do for what</i> so that the clinicians can decided to do and a masters degree program fo medical epidemiology in my current affiliation was recommended to me. So, 6 months after I graduated, I joined the program at Department of Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Mahidol Univeristy with the recommendation of the rector of the university and the head of the PCD department. </p>
