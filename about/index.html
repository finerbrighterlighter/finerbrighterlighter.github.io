	<h1>About me</h1>
	<body>
		<p>Burmese names are usually based on Pali words, and mine's no difference. Teza (တေဇ) comes from တေဇော, burmese transliteration of tejas which meaning fire. In the same Burmese fashion, I do not have a family name as well; both Htun and Teza are my own names, except when I have to communicate with like, the whole world, then I consider Teza as my last name. The reasoning was that "where one comes from should not affect how one should be treated", but yes, it's one of those "good, but didn't work". </p>
		<p>I hail from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyinmana">Pyinmana</a>, a small logging, horse riding, sugarcane growing town in the middle of Burma. As I hit ten, they told me we are no longer Pyinmana, but Nay Pyi Taw is swallowing us and a bunch of neighboring small towns into one big empty capital of Myanmar. And that's how I randomly became a city dweller from a rural bumpkin overnight.</p>
