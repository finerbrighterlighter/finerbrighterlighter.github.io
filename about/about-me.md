I hail from [Pyinamana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyinmana), a small logging, horse riding, sugarcane growing town in the middle of Burma. As I hit ten, they told me we are no longer Pyinmana, but Nay Pyi Taw is swallowing us and a bunch of neighboring small towns into one big empty captial of Myanmar. And that's how I randomly became a city dwelling slick from a rural bumpkin without moving a step at all.
